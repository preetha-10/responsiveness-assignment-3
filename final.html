                                There are many places to visit near Chennai that are popular side trips from the city. The tourist circuit of Chennai, Mammallapuram and Kanchipuram is often referred to as Tamil Nadu's Golden Triangle. These destinations can also be individually visited as day trips from Chennai. If you'd like to get close to nature, consider Vedantangal Bird Sanctuary or Madras Crocodile Bank. Further afield, Pondicherry attracts a lot of visitors from Chennai and can be covered on a long day trip. It's really worth staying there though, as it's a relaxing place to spend some time.
